In the upcoming lecture, you will get a few yellow deprecation warnings when we add code to our SignupScreen's navigation options.

If you are using expo v39+ you will need to do the following:

SignupScreen.navigationOptions = () => {
  return {
    headerShown: false,
  };
};
Older versions of Expo (such as v37) will need to write it this way:

SignupScreen.navigationOptions = () => {
  return {
    header: () => false,
  };
};
